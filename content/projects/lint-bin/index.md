I have been around and used 3D printers since they became more or less mainstream — first in university, then in hackerspaces, and now at work. While I have printed a few doodads, I haven't really modeled a lot myself. Recently, a colleague held a 3D modeling course/workshop, and I was able to make something useful — a litter bin for dryer lint. I embossed "lo" (lint) on it to indicate what it is for and to give it some character. It is stuck to the wall using command strips with velcro.
