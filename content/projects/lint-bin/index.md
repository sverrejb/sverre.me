I have been around and used 3D printers since they became more or less mainstream, first in university, hackerspaces and now at work. And while I have printed a few doodads, I havent really modeled a lot my self. Recently a colleague held a 3D modelling course/workshop, and I was able to make something useful! A litter bin for the dryer lint. I embossed "lo" (lint) on it to indicate what it is it for, and to give it some character.
