My [previous blog](https://blog.sverre.me) was made mostly as an exercise to get some experience with Elm. <!-- more --> I liked Elm, but it seems to have died off a bit. Not that everything need to be constantly developed, sometimes things can just be "done". I used Google Drive as the CMS for the blog, making writing a new post as simple as creating a new document in my "Blog"-folder. It worked well enough, but I did not end up using it much. The original post describing the development can be read [here](https://blog.sverre.me/post/1QOwy9tcS4NyC4wAMCdiJWgoTb8H23f7Li5az8vqopBw).
