This is my little corner of the web. This site is built with Zola, a static site generator written in Rust. It is deployed to Netlify, wich is by far the most user friendly platform I have used. I have been a fan of static site generators and the first wave of "JAM-stack" architecture for a long time. Serving only static files makes sense in many cases, and much more often than it is done, I suspect. Unless your website contains live content, or is updated multiple times per hour, static sites have great benefits:

* No backend -> Reduced attack vectors
* SEO with less effort
* Performance
* Cheap hosting, free in many cases
* Content can be version controlled in git
* The site is portable and can easily be hosted anywhere

Personally, I think a lot of the SPA's and fullstack websites out there would benefit greatly if they where made with a static site generator, a CMS and a automated CICD-pipeline.
