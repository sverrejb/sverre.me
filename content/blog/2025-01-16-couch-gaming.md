title="Couch gaming with WoL, Steamlink, gamepad and LG TV API"
+++

I recently purchased a mini PC to use as a media center and home server. One of the things I wanted to explore was streaming games from my desktop PC to the TV. This works well enough, but it is kind of a hassle to get to the gaming:

* If off, turn on the TV
* Select correct HDMI-input (no CEC on the mini PC)
* Launch SteamLink, which means I have to fish out the keyboard/trackpad-combo from under the table (Logitech K400)
* If it is not running, I also have to power on / wake the Desktop PC.

*Hardly a console-like experience!*

So instead of using my limited time to enjoy some gaming, I ended up scripting the whole thing. I wanted to be able to just pick up the gamepad and jump into a game. Using Python and [Alga](https://github.com/Tenzer/alga), I was able to achieve this quite nicely.

The script waits for a connected gamepad, and if present, listens for a specific button combo held for a few seconds. This triggers a set of steps that:

* Rumbles the controller to indicate that the script is started
* Turns on the TV, using Wake On Lan
* Turns on the desktop PC, also using Wake On Lan
* Sets the TV to the correct HDMI-input, using Alga
* Jiggles the mouse cursor, in cases where the TV is on and set to the right input, but the screensaver / screen blanking is active
* Launches the SteamLink-app

The script is configured to run as a service using systemd. The repository is [here](https://github.com/sverrejb/Couchgaming/tree/main). It is kludged together and can probably benefit from some TLC, but it works!
