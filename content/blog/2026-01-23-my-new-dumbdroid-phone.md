When I bought my last phone, I wanted a phone that took up less space in my pocket. I ended up with a Sony Xperia 10 VI, a phone I primarily chose because of it's comparably small size. It is not a *small* phone by any means, but, sadly, compared to almost all other contemporary and mainstream Android phones (in Europe), it is practially petite. The only other contender was the Asus Zenfone 10, which is slightly smaller.

And the Xperia has been great. The performance to price ratio is excellent and the battery life is awesome. It has a 3.5mm jack I have used at least a handful of times, and I have had no problem with bugs and crashes, which is more than I can say about my previous Pixel, Nokia or Honor phones.

## Zombie, zombie, zombie

More recently, and more pressing, I have wanted a phone that takes up less space *in my head*. I, like so many others, use my phone too much. The constant checking if anything has happened. The reflex to fish it out of my pocket the second other forms of stimuli is gone. At some point I realized I was checking my phone between tying my left and right shoe. Taking the elevator? Check phone. Waiting for the coffee machine? Check phone. You get the point.

But not only the small "downtimes" during the day were corrupted, longer stretches of free time became victims as well. The buss ride to work. The sweet moments of peace after the kids have fallen asleep. Watching a movie with my wife. The rare weekend mornings in bed when I am not the one to get up with the kids. A coffee and a pastry at a cafe. The phone whispers seductivly from my pocket. A screen time of four hours per day equals 2 months per year. I am gaming less than I want to. I have almost stopped reading, something that is, or was, a large part of who I am.

## Fix me

I have tried to fight this. I deleted my Facebook account (for several reasons). I uninstalled the Reddit app, the YouTube app, turned off all non-critical notifications. It worked. A little bit. Then I found myself scrolling Reddit in the web browser. Watching YouTube in the browser. And to my horror, LinkedIn seems to have replaced Facebook in that masochistic part of my brain.

I installed minimalistic launchers that are supposed to be less enticing. I installed the hillarious [Speedbump-app](https://speedbumpapp.com/en/). I enabled app and website time limits in Android's digital wellness settings. It all works, until it doesn't. For some reason I end up disabling them. A long boring wait at the doctor, or suddenly I actually need to check something important after I have reached my quota. And when it is disabled, it usually stays disabled. Until I recognize that I have fallen off the wagon.

Some will say I lack "willpower" or self-dicipline. I am not neccessarily disagreeing with that, but if it was that simple, some of the worlds biggest corporations wouldn't revolve around the attention economy. Phones are more addictive than optiates, I read somewhere. Having a brain that is already struggling with dopamine regulation probably doesn't help either. And when some of the smartest people in the world work on making the almighty algorithm serve you the stuff that makes your neurons go "aaah" just the right way, well 🤷‍♂️

## Dumb and dumber

I have considered getting a dumb phone. A simple call and message phone. But then I remember I live in 2026 and we have built our whole society around the stupid rectangles we carry around. Two factor authentication (Not a dumb idea itself, mind!). Direct payments (Vipps here in norway). Parking. Customer loyality programmes. Public transport tickets. Opening the freakin door to your appartment building. Yes, there are alternatives in most cases, but they are gradually either disappearing, becoming less convenient or more expensive. And some things are just plain useful. Like navigation and information on the go.

I *could* carry two phones, and keep the dumb phone in my pocket, and the dumber phone turned off in my backpack. But then I have to remember two phones when going out. And knowing myself, if I end up needing the so called smart one for something, I am suddenly back in the hole.


## Figure out this heading later.

Maybe ironically, the subreddit /r/dumbphone has made me aware of a phone segment I had no idea existed. The "semi-smart" (or semi-dumb?) phone. Android devices in the shape of the typical candy bar dumbphone. Some reccomend it as the sweet spot between. The small screen is not well suited for consuming addictive content, but is usable enough to look at maps or wikipedia in a pinch.  can be used in a pinch to BLAHBLAH BLAH write the rest tomorrow. 

 I also discovered the "Dumbdroid" project. An alternative OS aimed at some of these phones. I was intriqued. I set up a search with notifications on Finn.no and waited. A few weeks laterd I was able to snag a Duoqin F21 Pro for 500 NOK.

## Dumbdroid

Dumbdroid is an open-source Android-based operating system for small feature phones. The philosophy is simple: a tiny screen makes mindless scrolling and YouTube watching impractical, while still maintaining access to essential apps.

## Why I Switched

- Small screen discourages social media and video consumption
- Still have access to essential apps (WhatsApp, banking, 2FA, navigation, Spotify)
- Android Auto support for driving
- Privacy-focused (I'm running the vanilla variant with no Google services)

## The Device: Qin F21 Pro

- Physical keypad + touchscreen
- Dual cameras
- 4G/LTE connectivity
- Small form factor that fits anywhere

## ROM Variant: Vanilla

I chose the vanilla variant just to test. Less google intrusion is good.

## Stuff I had to figure out:

Google contacts via DAVx5
APN setup for telia
TT9 - How to update
TT9 - No nynorsk 😱
