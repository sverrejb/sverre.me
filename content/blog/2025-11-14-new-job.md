For a month now I have worked at Sikt. My last, and only other "proper job" was at Knowit. I worked there since I graduated in 2017. Eight years is a long time, especially in this industry, and it is not without reason i stayed there so long, even with other consultantsies promising greener pastures and more pay. But eventualy I felt the need to try something else. Being on parental leave when the kid already had started in daycare gave me some time. Time to think, read ads (ads?), write applications, polish my CV and go to interviews. And after meeting a lot of nice people, a couple of rejections, and a couple of offers I was in the priviliged position of having to choose between two very good employers. After some deliberating i chose Sikt.
